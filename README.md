# MacroTracker

This project tracks your daily macro intake. Making it nice and easy to track with day to day food intake.  

This is suitable for anybody who wants to keep on top of what they're eating and be able to track this in an easy to read format.

This project differs from mainstream "trackers" as it focuses more on the macros rather than calorie intake. 

How does it work?

1. Create/Design your meal in the "Create Meal" section. Here you can specify the type of chicken alonside with it's macros (see food packet) based on it's weight 
e.g - Chicken Breast,  Total Weight 500g, Protein 100g, Carbohydrates 0g, Fat, 5.5g
2. So let's say we've added the above meal, however, you're only eating 300g of Chicken Breast today. No trouble we've made this process this easy to change in the "Add Meal"
section where you  specificy the total weight and the food - Chicken Breast 300g, and we'll automatically calculate the correct macros for 300g. 
3.. Now that you've added to your day you can see your daily macro count so far to the right handside in the "Daily Information" section. To illistrate this easier we have also 
included a percentage bar.
