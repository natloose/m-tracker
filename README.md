# MacroTracker

This project tracks macro intake. Making it nice and easy to track your day to day food consumption. 

Suitable for anybody who wants to keep on track what they're eating in an easy to view format.

This project differs from mainstream "trackers" as it focuses more on the macros rather than the calorie intake. 

How does it work?

1. Simply Create/Design your meal in the "Create Meal" section. Here you can specify the type of food alonside it's macros based on it's weight 
e.g - Chicken Breast,  Total Weight 500g, Protein 100g, Carbohydrates 0g, Fat, 5.5g
2. So let's say we've added the above meal, however, you're only eating 300g of Chicken Breast today. No trouble we've made this process this easy to change in the "Add Meal"
section where you can specificy the total weight and the food - Chicken Breast 300g, and we'll automatically calculate the difference. 
3.. Now that you've added to your day you can see your daily macro count so far to the right handside in the "Daily Information" section. To illistrate this we have
total macro section and just underneath a percentage bar reflecting what you've taken in so far/your daily goal.
